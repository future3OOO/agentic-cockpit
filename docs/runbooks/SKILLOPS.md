# SkillOps

## Intent
Continuously improve skill instructions based on real execution outcomes.

## Basic cycle
1. Capture what changed and what failed.
2. Distill reusable rules into skills/runbooks.
3. Keep instructions concise and operational.
4. Prefer stable policy in runbooks, tactical guidance in skill files.
