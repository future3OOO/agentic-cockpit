# Opus Consult Skills Reference

Consult quality checklist:
- Verify task scope and intended action match.
- Verify dispatch targets and task kinds are coherent.
- Verify rollback path is explicit.
- Verify validation/tests are proportional to risk.
- Verify integration constraints (branch/base/ref) are respected.

Code suggestion policy:
- Suggestions must be minimal and targeted.
- Include `target_path`, `change_type`, and concrete `suggestion` text.
- Avoid speculative refactors unless required for correctness.
